# Simulated Metagenome Workflow

This repository contains a Nextflow workflow for simulating metagenomic data based on reference genomes. The workflow consists of two processes, `fetch_refs` and `gen_reads`, which fetch reference genomes using their accession numbers and generate simulated reads from the reference genomes, respectively.

## Requirements

- [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/getstarted.html#installation)
- [Conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simulated-metagenome-workflow.git
cd simulated-metagenome-workflowa
