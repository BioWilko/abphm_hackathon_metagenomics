Introduction:

Nextflow is a workflow management system that allows you to create, run, and manage complex data-driven workflows. It is particularly useful for handling large-scale, computationally intensive tasks such as those encountered in genomics and bioinformatics. The code you provided defines a Nextflow workflow for simulating metagenomic data based on reference genomes.

How to use:

Install Nextflow: To run this workflow, you'll need to have Nextflow installed on your system. You can install it by following the instructions on the Nextflow website.

Prepare the environment.yml file: This workflow uses Conda to manage dependencies. You'll need to create an environment.yml file containing the required packages. Based on the code you provided, it should at least include badread and any other packages needed by the ref_fetch.py script.

Create the ref_fetch.py script: This script is used to fetch reference genomes using their accession numbers. You'll need to create this script and make sure it can accept the provided command-line arguments.

Prepare the metadata manifest: This workflow requires a metadata manifest file (in TSV format) as input. This file should have a header and include columns for the ref_accession (reference genome accession number) and proportion (proportion of reads to simulate from this genome) for each taxon.

Run the workflow: To run the workflow, save the provided code to a file, such as simulate_metagenome.nf. Then, use the following command to execute the workflow


# Simulated Metagenome Workflow

This repository contains a Nextflow workflow for simulating metagenomic data based on reference genomes. The workflow consists of two processes, `fetch_refs` and `gen_reads`, which fetch reference genomes using their accession numbers and generate simulated reads from the reference genomes, respectively.

## Requirements

- [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/getstarted.html#installation)
- [Conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simulated-metagenome-workflow.git
cd simulated-metagenome-workflowa
